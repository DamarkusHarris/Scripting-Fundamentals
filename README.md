# Scripting-Fundamentals
Showcasing School Work 

This System Scripting Fundamentals course was the first course that introduced me to Python as far as School goes.
I have been teaching my self Python before than since i learned about the program awhile back. Python is by far my 
favorite language to learn. This course expanded my knowledge on the fundamentals of using programming languages to make 
logical decsisions, controlling the OS, and automate systems management. 

Using the IDE PyCharm I created a text based game called "Dodge, Parry, Thrust!", which is a play on the concept of
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Also, with my System Scripting Fundamentals course we worked with the Dark Sky weather API. I used this API
to return weather infomration for my Hometown, where I currently live and five additioinal places on the planet
i would like to visit. 

Lastly, I further my knowledge in Source Code Mangement. After watching the LinkedIN Learning Git-Essential Training 
video i demostrated installing Git, modifying files, adding files to the staging index and using commands like 
"git status" and "git diff --staged".
